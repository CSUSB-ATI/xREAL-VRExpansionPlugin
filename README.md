**Guides for migrating between different engine versions of the plugin:**

View the patch notes at www.vreue4.com for migration guides as well.

**Option 1:**

Go to www.vreue4.com and downloaded the pre-built binary version for the engine version you are using (not updated with every daily change, only weekly or with large patches).

Install it into your ProjectName/Plugins Directory (Engine level hasn't worked since 4.25 or so when it stopped letting me reference other plugins when compiling for that).

**Option 2 (More up to date - preferred if possible):**

-   Clone Or Download Zip and extract this repository into your "ProjectName/Plugins" directory, create this directory if it is missing.

-   Add the VRExpansionPlugin to your projects PublicDependencyModuleNames in the projects build.cs if you have c++ code included.

-   IF you do not have c++ code, use the Add New button in the editor and add a blank c++ class to your project.

-   Open up the generated project .SLN file and build the project from the build menu.

-   Copy over DefaultEngine, DefaultGameplayTags, DefaultScalability, and DefaultInput.ini files from the plugin folder to the Config folder of your project.

You need to have visual studio installed and follow the UE4 setup guide for it: https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Programming/Development/VisualStudioSetup/
